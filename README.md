# EnglishLearningApp
This is a web app to learn English from American sit-coms, where you can discover sit-coms and develop better English skills, and its name is *SitcomSpeaks*. The direct link to the web app: https://zzzbeozzz.github.io/EnglishLearningApp/  

## Introduction 
As for my project, I created a language learning app  that teaches English through English sit-coms, allowing the learner to learn English idioms, slang, vocabulary etc. to improve their English-speaking skills and be more confident in speaking English. This is the basic web app that only uses *Modern Family* as an example so far, due to it easier language use in the series and complete series publish on various websites. 

## Features 
In the application, although there are only one series allowed, the basic features are so far spot on.

-Learner will choose a sitcom to start learning (currently only *Modern Family* is available)

-Watch video clips with highlighted English phrases

-Answer multiple-choice questions to test learner understanding

-If choose wrong, they can choose again

-See definitions after correct answers

-Vibrant design with neon colors, animations, and glowing effects

## Files
There are files uploaded for referencing, including:

-index.html: The Sitcom selection page (currently only *Modern Family* is available)

-modern-family.html: Modern Family questions page

-styles.css: Styling of the app

-script.js: Logic for video playback and questions

-MP4 files: 10 video clips for the target learning phrases/words (to view, need to download as raw) 

## Limitations 
there are technical issues and copyright issues to acquire the video clips, thus the copyright issues. 
So data collected are mostly on China websites or YouTube, therefore the data collection seems insufficient. 

## Improvement and upcoming plans 
Acquiring data through other format such as purchasing CDs of Sitcom series, mp4 video clips then mgiht be enhanced, do not have to be raw file downlaod. More so, add more features written from revised proposa l such as level difficulties, multiplayer mode that these are worth to improve the app.
